A-Elizabeth it is in vain you say
D-Love not"—thou sayest it in so sweet a way:
E-In vain those words from thee or L.E.L.
N-Zantippe's talents had enforced so well:
I-Ah! if that language from thy heart arise,
Ceath it less gently forth—and veil thine eyes.
O-ndymion, recollect, when Luna tried
Lo cure his love—was cured of all beside—
Eis follie—pride—and passion—for he died.
